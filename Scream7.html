          'Scream 6' became a killer hit, but 'Scream 7' is up in the air after
          the exits of Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega. Here's what we know so
          far about the next 'Scream' installment.

          Core Four forever?! The love for Scream is bigger than ever, but the
          future of the franchise is up in the air. In its opening weekend,
          Scream 6 broke the franchise record by making $67 million at the box
          office. Scream 6 was the second film featuring a new generation of
          stars, including Jenna Ortega, Melissa Barrera, Mason Gooding, and
          Jasmin Savoy Brown.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November 2023, Melissa was removed from the cast of Scream 7. The
          actress was fired from the film over her comments regarding the
          Israel-Hamas conflict. One day later, it was reported that Jenna would
          not be returning for Scream 7 because of her Wednesday season 2
          shooting schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what does this mean for Scream 7? Hollywood Life is breaking down
          everything we know about Scream 7.

        <p>Is There Going To Be A Seventh ‘Scream’ Movie?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          Scream 7 was confirmed in August 2023 when Christopher Landon was
          announced as the new director. He’s taking over from Matt
          Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fifth Scream movie was released in January 2022. After it became a
          box office success, Scream 6 quickly got the green light. The sixth
          Scream movie filmed quickly took place from June to August 2022.
          Scream 7 was delayed due to the writers’ and actors’ strikes of 2023.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head2">
        <p>‘Scream 7’ Release Date</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          There’s no release date yet for a seventh Scream movie. Given the
          ongoing casting changes, it’s unclear when Scream 7’s production will
          get underway.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          Following Scream 6’s success, everyone assumed Scream 7 would feature
          the return of Scream’s “Core Four,” which includes Jenna Ortega as
          Tara, Melissa Barrera as Sam, Mason Gooding as Chad, and Jasmin Savoy
          Brown as Mindy. They all managed to survive their latest round with
          Ghostface.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Core Four is now the Core Two in the wake of Melissa’s
          firing and Jenna’s departure. Jenna’s exit is due to her Wednesday
          season 2 filming schedule. The Golden Globe nominee is expected to
          film the second season of the Netflix hit from April 2024 through the
          summer. There’s been no word about Jasmin and Mason’s roles in Scream
          7 amid these changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Spyglass’ stance is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for
          antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false
          references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or
          anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech,” Spyglass,
          the production company behind Scream, said in a statement regarding
          Melissa’s removal.

          Hayden Panettiere’s long-awaited return as Kirby Reed paved the way
          for more of the beloved character in the future. She was stabbed again
          by Ghostface, but she survived. She told Tara and Sam to call her if
          they “ever” needed anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kirby was the perfect bridge between the original legacy characters
          and the newbies. She also formed a sweet bond with Tara. Bring Kirby
          back, Scream 7!
        </p>
        <p>
          Courteney Cox’s Gale Weathers also survived another brutal attack by
          Ghostface. Courteney is the only original Scream character to have
          appeared in all 6 films so far. She would likely make an appearance in
          a seventh installment.

          As with all previous Scream films, a new batch of supporting
          characters would be introduced in Scream 7. One or a few of them could
          be the new Ghostface!

      <div class="text-inside-head2">
        <p>Will Neve Campbell Return For ‘Scream 7’?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          The Scream world was shocked in June 2022 when Neve Campbell revealed
          that she would not be returning as Sidney Prescott in Scream 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Sadly, I won’t be making the next Scream film,” Neve said in a
          statement. “As a woman, I have had to work extremely hard in my career
          to establish my value, especially when it comes to Scream. I felt the
          offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I have
          brought to the franchise.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Neve’s absence was felt in Scream 6. She was mentioned briefly after
          the latest set of Ghostface attacks. Gale revealed that Sidney
          wouldn’t be coming to New York. Sidney and Mark took their kids to a
          safe spot to hide out from Ghostface.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img
        width="700"
        height="394"

      />
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          Sidney Prescott will always remain a core part of the Scream world,
          but Neve’s decision to not come back didn’t completely change the
          story of Scream 6. “This was always the story we wanted to tell, which
          is really exciting we were able to do it,” writer James Vanderbilt
          told Variety. “The Sam and Tara sister story was always the thing we
          wanted to be front and center in this. We love Neve and think she’s
          amazing and had a great experience with her on [Scream] 5. She needs
          to do what she needs to do as a business woman and we totally support
          that.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Director Tyler Gillett added, “I think what ultimately happened was we
          knew that if anything, in the absence of that character, we had to
          really dig deeper into the core four and make those relationships
          matter in a really emotional way. The goal was to try to form a
          connection between those characters and the audience the way that we
          formed a connection with Gale, Dewey, and Sid. At the end of the day,
          that’s just about having the time and the real estate in your story to
          really dig deep. But no, it wasn’t a wildly dramatic pivot.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Neve hasn’t ruled out bringing Sidney back into the fold. “I don’t
          know that I’m done for good,” the actress tells PEOPLE in August 2022.
          “It would really depend on what they came to me with next. It would
          have to be different. It would have to be a different attitude, and
          I’m not sure that’s going to happen.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The actress continued, “If they came to me with a number that felt
          right, that felt respectful, that felt in keeping with my value that I
          brought to the franchise, I’d be willing to consider [returning in the
          future].”I don’t believe it’s dead in the water, but we’ll see. But
          honestly, I’m really okay. I’ve been able to let it go. I wish them
          well. I’m doing three different shows right now. I’m very, very
          grateful that I’m working. I’m happy. So all is good.”

      <div class="text-inside-head2"><p>Is Stu Macher Alive?</p></div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          That’s the million-dollar question. OG killer Stu was seemingly killed
          in the first Scream movie after being stabbed and electrocuted when a
          television falls on his head. However, a legion of Scream fans are
          holding out hope that Stu somehow survived and has been living in
          hiding for all this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scream 5 featured Stu’s nephew briefly, but he was killed quickly by
          Ghostface. The big showdown went down at Stu Macher’s old house just
          like in the original.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scream 6 directly referenced Stu Macher. At the Ghostface shrine
          warehouse, the Core Four and others came face-to-face with key items
          from past killings, including the TV that supposedly killed Stu. When
          Kirby brings up the TV that killed Stu, Mindy quipped, “If you believe
          he’s dead.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <img
        width="700"
        height="394"
        src="images/scream-7-embed-6.webp"
        alt="https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scream-7-embed-6.jpg"
      />
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          Scream’s original screenwriter, Kevin Williamson, has said that Stu is
          dead dead. “No, he’s dead. I think that started because of the college
          scene, the frat party scene because he’s standing in the background.
          He just came to visit set that night,” he told Collider.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest Scream team isn’t so concrete about Stu’s fate. “There’s no
          good answer, so I will never confirm or deny stuff like that,” James
          Vanderbilt told Variety. Producer William Sherak added, “Anything’s
          possible.” Producer Paul Neinstein also said, “Characters can come in
          and out! There’s different ways to do it. It’s such a part of all of
          their lives; they have an affinity for Scream.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if Stu is dead, he could come back as Skeet Ulrich’s Billy
          Loomis, who has appeared in the latest two films in Sam’s head. If Stu
          somehow is still alive, that would be the ultimate twist. Scream 7
          could follow the theme of Scream 3: the past can always comes back to
          bite you.
