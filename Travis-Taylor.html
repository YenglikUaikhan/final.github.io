          Travis Kelce is quite the talker! The Kansas City Chiefs tight end
          hasn’t hesitated to comment on his relationship with Taylor Swift, and
          we’ve got all of his sweetest quotes about her rounded up! From
          interviews to podcast appearances, read everything that Travis has
          said about Taylor so far.

      <div class="text-inside-head2">
        <p>‘I Was Butthurt’</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          In July — two months before they apparently began their relationship —
          Travis revealed that he unsuccessfully tried to give Taylor his phone
          number on a friendship bracelet at one of her Eras Tour concerts.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her
          shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she
          sings,” he explained on his and brother Jason Kelce’s “New Heights
          Show” podcast. “So, I was little butthurt that I didn’t get to hand
          her one of the bracelets I made for her.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Travis also acknowledged that he “received a bunch” of friendship
          bracelets at Taylor’s concert. “But I wanted to give Taylor Swift one
          with my number on it,” he continued. “She doesn’t meet anybody, or at
          least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal [sic].”

      <div class="text-inside-head2"><p>‘I’ve Seen You Rock the Stage’</p></div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          In September, Travis publicly invited Taylor to attend one of his
          games in Kansas City, where she has performed in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’ve seen you rock the stage at Arrowhead [Stadium]. You might have
          to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead and see which one’s a
          little more lit,” he teased during an appearance on The Pat McAfee
          Show.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head2"><p>‘Shout-out to Taylor’</p></div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          After the “Bad Blood” singer attended her first game at Arrowhead
          Stadium, Travis said Taylor was “pretty ballsy” for showing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m enjoying life and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend,” the
          athlete said on his podcast in September. “Shout-out to Taylor for
          pulling up. That was pretty ballsy. … I just thought it was awesome
          how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about
          her — the friends and family. She looked amazing and everybody was
          talking about her in great light.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Travis added, “To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high
          fives with mom [Donna Kelce], to see how, you know, Chiefs kingdom was
          all excited that she was there — that s**t was absolutely hysterical,
          and it was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for damn sure.”
        </p>

      <div class="text-inside-head2">
        <p>‘Even More on Top of the World’</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          While speaking at a press conference in October, the football player
          said he felt “even more on top of the world” than he felt after
          winning the Super Bowl in the past.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head2"><p>‘I Feel Terrible for Taylor’</p></div>
      <p>
        After the award-winning songwriter attended her third Chiefs game,
        Travis joked that he “felt terrible” that his girlfriend had to talk to
        his dad, Ed Kelce, during the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You know dad like I know dad,” Travis said to Jason on the brothers’
        podcast in October. “This is a terrifying conversation. I felt terrible
        for Taylor for being in this.”
      </p>
      <div class="text-inside-head2"><p>‘Protective’ on Dates</p></div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          During the same podcast episode, Travis and Jason rehashed all the
          buzz surrounding photos that surfaced of Travis and Taylor in New York
          City.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I feel like whenever I’m on a date, I’m always having the sense of
          like, I’m a man in the situation, I’m, like, protective, yeah for
          sure,” the two-time Super Bowl winner said. “You always kind of have
          that feeling — or that self-awareness, I guess.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head2">
        <p>His Reaction to the ‘Karma’ Lyric Change</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          While Taylor hasn’t really spoken about their romance publicly, she
          did give Travis a nod during her Argentina concert, where she changed
          a line in the song “Karma” to be “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs
          coming straight home to me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          After the fact, Travis talked about it on his New Heights podcast. He
          revealed that it was a major moment for him. “I had no clue… well, I
          might of had a little bit of a clue, but definitely when I heard it
          come out of her mouth still shocked me,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tight end also apologized to Taylor’s dad after he snubbed him for
          a high five in his excitement. “I missed that. I never miss a high
          five, too. Big high five guy. It’s the most electric thing you can do
          at an event. So, sorry, Mr. Swift,” he said.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head2">
        <p>He’s ‘Never Dated Anyone Like’ Taylor Swift</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          He spoke more at length about his relationship with Taylor during an
          interview with WSJ magazine, published on November 20, 2023. He said
          that he “never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them.” He
          proceeded to talk about how different it was to date her with all the
          public attention on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travis also spoke more about how he thinks their values align. “Her
          team is her family. Her family does a lot of stuff in terms of the
          tour, the marketing, being around, so I think she has a lot of those
          values as well, which is right up my alley,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also detailed their first meeting, after some time talking. “When I
          met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we
          could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from
          there will go from there,” he said.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-inside-head2"><p>‘Love’?</p></div>
      <div class="text-inside-head3">
        <p>
          While speaking on his “New Heights” podcast, Travis told his brother,
          Jason, his thoughts about his WSJ Magazine cover story, and fans
          believed they heard him say he loves Taylor.
        </p>
        <p>
          “They did an awesome job with the article,” he explained. “I thought
          it was cool how they showcased just my love for not only Kansas City
          but my love for the people that I have around me. It was awesome.”
