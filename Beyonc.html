          We’re definitely thankful for Beyoncé during this Thanksgiving season.
          The “Crazy in Love” singer, 42, made a surprise appearance during the
          Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade to share a new trailer for her
          Renaissance tour movie on Thursday, November 23. Bey looked absolutely
          stunning in the short pre-recorded video message before the new
          trailer played.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the clip, Beyoncé had on a black top with some white polka dots on
          the short sleeves. She wore her hair in a flowing, slightly curled
          style, and she accessorized with some long, sparkling earrings. “Hey,
          it’s Beyoncé, wishing you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving,”
          she said. “I’m so honored to share with you the first look at the new
          Renaissance film trailer.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The trailer then gave fans new glimpses of the upcoming concert movie.
          It began with a cute moment where Beyoncé was talking to her younger
          daughter Rumi Carter, 6, who was filming with a phone. The singer told
          her to turn it on the side to film. The other clips shown in the
          trailer included some backstage footage and some behind-the-scenes
          moments taken from the tour. Naturally, there were also plenty of
          performance clips and crowd shots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyoncé dropped the worldwide trailer for the concert movie earlier in
          November, after releasing the first trailer back in October. The movie
          will give many more members of the Beyhive to see her Renaissance tour
          concert in theaters on December 1.
