          Miley Cyrus is one of the music industry’s biggest chameleons. Check
          out how the star went from her Disney Channel roots to a master of
          mayhem with some of her best photos over the years!
        </p>
        <p>
          Miley Cyrus has seriously gone through a major change since her time
          as ‘Hannah Montana’. The series started in 2006 and lasted until 2011,
          with a film released in 2009 to boot. But by 2010, Miley was ready to
          announce herself as a mature teen pop star. She starred in the film
          ‘The Last Song’ with her future husband Liam Hemsworth and released
          her album ‘Can’t Be Tamed’ the same year.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2013, Miley completely changed her tune to something that suited
          her with her album ‘Bangerz.’ She became a total sensation and created
          viral moments with her music videos like “Wrecking Ball” and “Adore
          You.” She also had one of the most infamous performances on the MTV
          VMAs in the mid-2010s.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the latter half of the decade, Miley devoted herself to her
          philanthropy with her Happy Hippie Foundation and married Liam in
          2018. Their romance, however, would come to an end by 2019 as the
          couple sought a divorce, which was finalized by 2020. After a fling
          with Kaitlynn Carter, Miley moved on to Cody Simpson and since their
          split in Aug. 2020, she has been playing the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s no wonder why we can’t stop thinking about Miley! Take a look at
          her transformation in the images throughout this gallery.

          The duo would fall head-over-heels, getting engaged in 2012, but they

        <p>
          Liam was the first to break his silence on the split in Aug. 2019,
          posting an Instagram that said, “Just a quick note to say that Miley
          and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and
          happiness going forward. This is a private matter and I have not made,

          changed forever…It inspired me to use my platform for something much
