          Matthew Perry‘s heartbreaking death on October 28 has left his former
          Friends co-stars grieving. Nearly one month later, a source close to
          the A-listers told Life & Style that the pals have become “even
          closer” amid the tragedy. “They’re processing it in different ways and
          sharing when they’re ready,” the insider explained on November 22. “If
          there is any good news, it’s that the cast is even closer than ever
          before.”

          As comedy fans know, the late 54-year-old starred in Friends from 1994
          until the series finale in 2004. His former co-stars include Jennifer
          Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David
          Schwimmer. “His death has left a huge hole in the hearts of his former
          cast members,” the source went on to add of the group’s emotional
          reaction to Matthew’s passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, the group released a statement about Matthew’s death with
          PEOPLE on October 30. “We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of
          Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family,” the
          somber letter read two days after Matthew’s death. “There is so much
          to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and
          process this unfathomable loss.” The co-stars went on to add that they
          would “say more” when they were ready. “In time we will say more, as
          and when we are able,” they added. “For now, our thoughts and our love
          are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him
          around the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt, 56, was the first Friends alum to break his silence via
          Instagram on November 14. “Matthew It is with a heavy heart I say
          goodbye. The times we had together are honestly among the favorite
          times of my life. It was an honor to share the stage with you and to
          call you my friend,” he wrote in the caption of the post. “I will
          always smile when I think of you and I’ll never forget you. Never.
          Spread your wings and fly brother you’re finally free. Much love. And
          I guess you’re keeping the 20 bucks you owe me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Jennifer, 54, took to Instagram on November 15 to pen an
          open letter to her late friend. “Oh boy this one has cut deep… Having
          to say goodbye to our Matty has been an insane wave of emotions that
          I’ve never experienced before,” her caption began over a series of
          photos with Matthew. “Matty, I love you so much and I know you are now
          completely at peace and out of any pain. I talk to you every day…
          sometimes I can almost hear you saying ‘could you BE any crazier?'”
        </p>
        <p>
          Around the same time, David also took to social media to mourn his
          former co-star and friend. “Matty, Thank you for ten incredible years
          of laughter and creativity,” his caption began, before he concluded
          with, “I imagine you up there, somewhere, in the same white suit,
          hands in your pockets, looking around.” Matthew is survived by his
          father, John Bennett Perry, his mother, Suzanne Morrison, his
          stepfather, Keith Morrison, and five siblings.
